Yesterday i finished that interview of damo mitchel. Pretty nice. I got his book andnow i am reading about [Nei Gong](journal.org) practice.

Gong and Fa. Quality and technique
Wei wu wei. do not doing. Beggines should be moving 90 percent and 10 percent of the time static.
when the effect is achieved ne must meve more toward wu wei.

```python
import sys

so = 4
carro = 20
l = so + carro
return l
```
